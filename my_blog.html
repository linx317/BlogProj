Today was the first day of CSSI. We went over the basics of HTML, CSS, and javascript. We worked on a lab assignment
where we made changes to a pre-written website. We added colors, background images, various font-sizes, and etc. We also
visited the dining halls in the building. Hopefully, I will get to learn a lot this summer. Especially with the server
side scripting and back-end stuff.
